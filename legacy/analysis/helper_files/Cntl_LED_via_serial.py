serial_send_LED.py

Description: 
Control the LED on a microcontroller with serial communication from your computer. 

 Required installs: pyserial 
    - https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shortintro.html

 Reference: https://www.youtube.com/@von14

 Process: 
    - Run the .ino file on the logger 
    - In terminal run this .py file 
    - It will list the COM's available, select the one associated to the logger (typically COM4)
    - Commands available (case sensitive): 
        - ON: Turn on the red LED
        - OFF: Turn off the red LED
        - exit: exit the python script 
    - Any user input other than the ones provided will cause the green LED to light up 

 Communication requirements:
    - The Adalogger has the TSAMD21G18 ARM Cortex M0 processor same as Arduino Zero
    - The Arduino Zero takes utf-8 communication
    - utf-8: UNICODE Universal Coded Character Set Transformation Format - 8-bit

 Selecting ports: 
    - When running serial.tools.list_ports.comports() and viewing the list of ports we
        want to select the USB Serial Device associated to our Adalogger
