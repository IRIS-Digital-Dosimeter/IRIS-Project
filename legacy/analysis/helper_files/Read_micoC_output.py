readSerialLine.py

Description: 
- reads incoming serial communication from the adafruit microcontroller

Required installs: pyserial 
    - https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shortintro.html

Reference: https://www.youtube.com/@von14

 Process: 
    - Run the .ino file on the logger 
    - In terminal run this .py file 
    - It will list the COM's available, select the one associated to the logger (typically COM4)
    - Serial line will output serial communication from Adalogger
 Communication requirements:
    - The Adalogger has the TSAMD21G18 ARM Cortex M0 processor same as Arduino Zero
    - The Arduino Zero takes utf-8 communication
    - utf-8: UNICODE Universal Coded Character Set Transformation Format - 8-bit

 Selecting ports: 
    - When running serial.tools.list_ports.comports() and viewing the list of ports we
        want to select the USB Serial Device associated to our Adalogger
