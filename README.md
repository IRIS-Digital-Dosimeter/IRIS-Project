# IRIS Digital Dosimeter Project

**By Michelle Pichardo, Andrew Yegiayan, Aidan Zinn, and David Smith**

The Intense Radiation Integrating Sensor (IRIS) is a novel digital dosimeter for detecting terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) - intense, millisecond-long bursts of gamma rays originating from thunderstorms that pose potential radiation hazards to aircraft and the public. IRIS will capture real-time dose rate measurements on 10 ms timescales using custom instrumentation featuring a microcontroller for digitization and timing, photodiodes for wide dynamic range, and scintillator and GPS modules.

## Accompanying Documentation
While there are several READMEs scattered throughout this repository, please refer to our [public notes](https://iris-digital-dosimeter.github.io/) for a comprehensive overview of the software side of the project.

## Contents

1. `analysis` \
This directory contains Python programs specifically designed for the analysis of data files generated by the IRIS unit. The primary focus of these programs is to address concerns related to time gaps that occur during data storage. These gaps, if not managed properly, may result in missing significant events entirely.

2. `docs` \
The Docs directory comprises drawings, files, and images essential for the analysis of IRIS data. These resources contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the project.

3. `packages` \
The Packages directory houses all immediately usable sketches and scripts relevant to the IRIS Digital Dosimeter project.

4. `sandbox` \
The Sandbox directory houses in-development or reference sketches that aid development.

5. `legacy` \
The Legacy directory holds old unused files and such in order to declutter the repo.

## Troubleshooting

### **Port not detected**

The Serial port is busy-stuck in use by something, so we must force it into bootloader mode to return to a clean slate.
